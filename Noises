Noise == unwanted disturbance in electrical signal which is generated by electronic devices.
Noise is an error random disturbance of a useful information signal which generates from natural,
sometimes man-made sources. Noise is distinguish from distortion[altering of the original characteristic
of something. Alteration of the waveform of an information-bearing signal.The noise is unwanted, but
useful for random number generator, dither[intentionally applied noise used to randomize.

Thermal Noise [Johnson-Nyquist] 
Is unavoidable and generated by the random thermal motion of charge carriers iside the electrical 
conductor which happens regardless of any voltage applied. Similar to white. Thermal noise is often 
modeled as an additive white Gaussian noise [AWGN] channel.

Cosmic Noise

Distant stars generate noise [8MHZ - 1.433 GHz].

Burst Noise

Consists of sudden transitions between two or more levels at random times, lasts for several microseconds
and the intervals between pulses tend to be in the audio range. Intervals between pulses tend to be in the
audio range [less than 100 Hz] 

Shot Noise

Random statistical fluctuations of the electric current when charge carriers traverse a gap. When electrons
flow through the barrier[s.t. diode is used] => electrons have a discrete arrival times which makes shot noise.

Transit-time Noise

The time taken by the electrons from traveling from emitter to collector becomes comparable to the period of 
the signal being amplified [at frequencies above VHF "very high frequency" 30-300 MHz corresponding wavelengths 
- 10 to 1 meter frequencies ,are denoted high frequency] 

Flicker Noise
1/f noise == signal or process with a frequency spectrum [any signal which has variable that varies in time
has a frequency spectrum]. Is a result from a variety of effects, always related to a direct current..
